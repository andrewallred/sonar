# sonar

Sonar is a method of echolocation used in air or water, as well as an Objective C tvOS app to bring Bandcamp to the AppleTV.

Currently learning to crawl.

## Why make this app?

Simple, I wanted to listen to my favorite Bandcamp artists on my AppleTV.

## What's it look like?

Sonar uses the out of the box tvOS UI. You can take a look at screenshots [here](screenshots/) (with a special shoutout to [Deep Jungle](https://deepjungle.bandcamp.com/)).

## Why Objective C?

I've got a bit of a soft spot for Objective C, and in this case it was the quickest path to a proof of concept. That said, Swift would be the right choice to greenfield this as an enterprise product.
